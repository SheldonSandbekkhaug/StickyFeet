Based on Sticky Feet program by Greg Turk at the Georgia Institute of technology (turk@cc.gatech.edu).

StickyFeet is a ecosystem simulation capable of virtual evolution. Creatures evolve both body structure and behavior in a 2D environment.
In the begining of the simulation, the creatures are simple. Over time, new creature types develop and more sophisticated phenotypes appear.
